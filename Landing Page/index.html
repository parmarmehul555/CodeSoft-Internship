            <label>Camera</label>
            <p>Apple introduced major camera upgrades on all the iPhone 15 models. The main cameras on iPhone 15 and
                iPhone 15 Plus are bumped up from 12 megapixels (MP) to 48MP. The new camera offers optical quality
                (versus inferior digital) 2x zoom by cropping the middle 12MP of the 48MP sensor. That's a
                meaningful new option in Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus
            </p>
            <label>Bettery life</label>
            <p>iPhone 15: battery life
                Apple spent no time talking about specifics related to battery life for the iPhone 15 generation, as
                there's no claimed improvement here at all for any of the iPhone 15 models — we can expect similar
                battery life to the iPhone 14 generation, which was generally excellent. The iPhone 14 Plus especially
                wowed us and still holds the best result out of any phone in our battery test.
            </p>
            <label>Displays</label>
            <p>Apple made no changes to its usual display size on the iPhone 15 generation. However, the iPhone 15 and
                iPhone 15 Plus received updated displays with a brighter 2000 nits compared to the 1200-nit iPhone 14
                display.
            </p>

            <label>Design</label>
            <p>All iPhone 15 models received Apple's latest design with softer contoured edges compared to the sharper
                edges on the iPhone 14 generation. The contoured edges should make the iPhone 15 generation more
                comfortable to hold, overall.
            </p>
            <p>A Titanium frame with a brushed metal aesthetic replaces shiny polished steel on the iPhone 15 Pro and
                iPhone 15 Pro Max, which makes for a lighter weight overall. Indeed, the iPhone 15 Pro is 6.6 ounces
                compared to the 7.27-ounce iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 7.81 ounces compared to the heavy
                8.47-ounce iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>
            <label>Colors</label>
            <p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature Apple's new color-infused back glass with a frosted matte
                texture available in five color options, including blue, pink, yellow, green, and black.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;padding-top: 4vh;color: azure;">Should you buy iPhone an 15?</h1>
        <p>The iPhone 15 series offers a slate of upgrades and new features that may well be worth your money, depending
            on your priorities and on which phone you're upgrading from.</p>

        <p>Upgrading to the iPhone 15 generation for any specific new feature, no matter how small, is less costly and
            easier than ever. Apple and carriers offer excellent trade-in offers depending on your existing iPhone's age
            and condition, and if you can swap your old phone and get the new one for free or at a significant discount
            through any of the best iPhone 15 deals or iPhone 15 Pro deals, it's tough to argue against upgrading to the
            iPhone 15 series.</p>

        <p>We can say the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus' cameras are a major upgrade, especially the new ability to use
            the 48MP sensor as a 12MP 2x optical zoom lens. That adds meaningful versatility while maintaining high
            photo quality. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's 5x "tetraprism" zoom lens needs a closer look before any final
            judgments, but if you've ever wished you could take better photos of far-away subjects, it's certainly worth
            considering an upgrade.</p>

        <p> The lighter titanium frame is a worthwhile evolution for the iPhone 15 Pro models — I've always said the
            iPhone 14 Pro series, especially the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is ridiculously heavy for a daily device. Apple's
            latest contoured edge design is also tempting, as I find the sharper design kicked off by the iPhone 12
            through to the iPhone 14 to be actively uncomfortable.</p>

        <p> USB-C on the iPhone 15 generation is certainly a welcome addition, as it lets you charge your phone with the
            same cable as your Mac, iPad (if they're USB-C models, too), and any other device that uses USB-C for
            charging. However, since iPhone users already have Lightning cables, we wouldn't say it's a feature that's
            worth an urgent upgrade.</p>

        <p> We can say for sure that if you own an iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or any iPhone model from before
            2017, you'll want to seriously consider upgrading to a newer iPhone, whether it's the iPhone 15, iPhone 14,
            or iPhone 13 generations that Apple offers. It's worth noting that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus received
            a $100 price drop for new $699 and $799 starting prices, respectively. The iPhone 13 was also reduced a
            further $100, bringing its starting price down to $599.</p>

        <p> Apple's iPhones are historically solid, save for odd software bugs that are often addressed in software
            updates — you generally know you're going to get a reliable phone, and the iPhone 15 series should be no
            exception. </p>
